For this project, I was provided with starter code that created the structure of the program.  I created the core functionality code which allowed the program to run without errors and display results until the test case met criteria. I created testing code to verify that the program worked correctly.
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing, building, and improving software and systems. Their work matters because it powers the technology we use daily, from medical systems to communication tools.
I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts, planning solutions before coding, and testing as I work. I also research similar problems when needed and stay open to improving my solutions.
As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to create programs that are safe, secure, and fair for users. I must protect user privacy, prevent harm, be honest about limitations, and ensure that my work supports the goals and values of the organization.
